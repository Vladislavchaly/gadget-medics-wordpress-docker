The SetMore plugin enables your customers to book appointments with you online via your WordPress website.


== Description ==


Setmore is beautifully designed, simple, and powerful appointment scheduling that's free and online. Book appointments with your customers, manage multiple staff calendars, send automated reminders, and take payments using your Square account, all from the Setmore app.

= How it works with WordPress =

The Setmore widget for WordPress allows you to put a "Book Appointment" button on your WordPress-powered website. Customers on your site can click the button to access your Setmore Booking Page, and book an appointment with you online.

This saves you time from handling appointment scheduling over the phone or in person while helping ensure your calendar is full of appointments to support your business growth goals.

= What Setmore offers =

Every Setmore account comes with a free online Booking Page where your customers can schedule appointments with your business online. The Booking Page lists your staff, services, and availability, and is customizable with your company logo and contact information.
